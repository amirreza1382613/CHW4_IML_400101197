        "Sometimes, the data is not linearly separable. Therefore, the previous formulation of the Soft-Margin SVM does not give a good accuracy for the classification problem. The Kernel trick is a technique used in such situations. Consider $x$ as your input features with dimension $p$. One can use function $\\phi: R^p → R^d$ to map the input features to another space with dimension $d$. Finding good $\\phi$ such that data points become near linearly separable makes the previous formulation of the problem and its dual useful by replacing $\\phi(x_i)$ for $x_i$ in the problem definition. The function $\\phi(x)$ can even be a mapping to an infinite-dimensional space.\n",

        "If you have found the correct dual form of the Soft-Margin SVM in the previous formulation, you can see that the terms $x_i^T x_j$ will appear in the problem formulation and the prediction rule. These terms will be replaced with $\\phi(x_i)^T \\phi(x_j)$ when we use $\\phi$ as our feature mapping function. Given a feature mapping $\\phi$ we define its corresponding **Kernel** to be:\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, given $\\phi$, we could easily compute $K(x,z)$ by finding $\\phi(x)$ and $\\phi(z)$ and taking their inner product. But what’s more interesting is that often, $K(x,z)$ may be very inexpensive to calculate, even though $\\phi(x)$ itself may be very expensive to calculate (perhaps because it is an extremely high-dimensional vector).
